In this scenario, we learned how to:
- Set up a Cassandra cluster running on Kubernetes and install the example Pet Clinic app
- Install and configure Prometheus to monitor Cassandra and K8s
- Install and configure Grafana to view metrics for Cassandra and K8s
- Configure Prometheus and Grafana to monitor our Pet Clinic app

If you want to know more about Prometheus and Grafana, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Sl21AKiDg&t=26s) a good video tutorial.

What could be better than using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring your clusters?

Well, how about if it were already installed and configured!
<br>
Oh, wait! Is this all set up so we see how really cool K8ssandra is?
